# design-pattern-examples
Examples of the design patterns for the class.



#How to use this repository
Each pattern in the repository will have it's own Main class. This is where the main method lives, as
well as everything needed to have console interactions. Every pattern will have some comments explaining 
how to use it if necessary.

##What these are
These are to showcase the patterns taught in this class and provide a way for you to see them in a simple form.

##What these are not
These are not perfect examples. In fact there will be bad code because these will usually have one and only
 one pattern incorporated in the example. This is to prevent confusion or conflation with other patterns.
 Some of the challenge questions, discussed below, will ask you how to improve the code. 

#Challenge Questions
Each pattern will have at least one question in its comments. These are there to help you 
* Learn how to refactor code to improve it
* Incorporate other patterns into the code
* Test your knowledge of the pattern

#Contributing/Bugs
If you find any bugs or have a suggestion to improve an example open an issue and/or a pull request.
